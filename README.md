# 🧠 Memory Game (Python)

**Memory Game** is a classic concentration game where the goal is to match all hidden pairs of cards. The game starts with all cards face down, and the player can flip two cards at a time. If the cards match, they stay face up; if not, they are hidden again. The game ends when all pairs are found.
